Let’s get it started.

##a) What is OpenGL/WebGL?##

##b) Setting up ##

##c) Running your first program##


One of the classic first programs one writes is called “hello world”, which basically outputs the text `“hello world”` on your screen. We could do that (`println(“hello world”);`) but the basic output of Processing is graphic not text. So let’s write:

```java
rect(25,25,50,50);    
```

##c) CPU / GPU##

##d) 3D scene##
