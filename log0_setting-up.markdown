Let’s get it started.

## a) What is OpenGL/WebGL?

## b) Setting up

## c) Running your first program


One of the classic first programs one writes is called “hello world”, which basically outputs the text `“hello world”` on your screen. We could do that (`println(“hello world”);`) but the basic output of Processing is graphic not text. So let’s write:

~~~ javascript
alert("test");    
~~~

## c) CPU / GPU

## d) 3D scene
