## a) Explanation of both shaders (vertex, fragment)
### basic concept 
* glsl language : based on C language
* variable types : float, vec2, vec3
* qualifiers : uniforms, attributes and varyings

### little modifications to test & understand
* change the position in the vertex shader
* change the color in the fragment shader

## b) Compilation
* the function we have already (change "alert" to "console.log" or something)

## c) Little modifications
* correct rotations
* translations

## d) Not so related: WebGL Init
* Deal with the last piece of the library, and ditch the import in the header! Yay, you're free!
