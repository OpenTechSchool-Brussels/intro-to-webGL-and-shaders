## a) Explanation of both shaders (vertex, fragment)
* little modifications to test & understand

## b) Compilation
* the function we have already (change "alert" to "console.log" or something)

## c) Little modifications
* correct rotations
* translations

## d) Not so related: WebGL Init
* Deal with the last piece of the library, and ditch the import in the header! Yay, you're free!
